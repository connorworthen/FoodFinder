Hi Connor!

Some quick notes:

1. How do you typically load your site? (do you use LiveServer, or open the index.html file in the browser?)

- When I use LiveServer, your app is stuck in an infinite loop, fetching the restaurants repeatedly.

- When I open the idex.html file in Chrome, it doesn't infinitely loop, but I am still not able to click `Create Restaurant` to invoke the modal and test your fetch request.

2. Please see the documentation below for ideas on how to organize your code:

- [AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

- [Object-oriented JavaScript for beginners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS)

When you get your app back to a place where we can bring up the form to create a new restaurant, feel free to ping me and I can pull your changes down on my forked copy and take another look.
